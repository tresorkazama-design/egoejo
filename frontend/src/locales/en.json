And these are among them mysteries so hidden that only the elders can speak of them with credit and authority, to be believed. Whence it comes that a certain young man having discoursed to me about it, said to me boasting, Am I not very learned? Some tell me that the house of these two Deities is at the end of the world towards the East. Now among them the world does not extend beyond their Country, that is to say America, others lodge them in the middle. This God and this Goddess live like them, but without want; make feasts like them, are lascivious as well as they: in short they figure them all such as they themselves are. And although they make them men and corporeal, they nevertheless seem to attribute to them a certain immensity in all places. They say that this Eataentsic fell from Heaven, where there are inhabitants as here, and that when she fell, she was pregnant. But if you ask them who made Heaven and the inhabitants, they have no other answer, except that they know nothing about it. And when we preach to them a God, Creator of Heaven and earth and all things: likewise when we speak to them of a Hell and a Paradise, and the rest of our mysteries; the obstinate respond, that this is good for our Country, not for theirs; that each Country has its ways of doing.\"",

            "text": "\"The evolution of Western mentality has been driven by a heroic effort to forge an autonomous and rational human being by separating it from the primordial unity with nature.\n\nThe religious, scientific and philosophical perspectives of Western culture have been affected by this decisive masculinity, beginning four millennia ago with the great patriarchal conquest of the nomads, in Greece and the Levant, of the ancient matrifocal cultures, conquests manifest in the patriarchal religion of the West, of Judaism, in the rationalist philosophy of Greece and in the objectivist science of modern Europe.\n\nAll have served the cause of the development of human autonomous will and intellect: the transcendent self, the independent individual ego, and the self-determined human being in his uniqueness, his difference and his freedom. But to do this, the masculine spirit has repressed the feminine. Whether we see it in the subjugation of pre-Hellenic matrifocal mythologies of ancient Greece, in the Judeo-Christian denial of the Mother Goddess, or in the exaltation of the detached and self-conscious rational ego of the Enlightenment, an ego that is radically separated from a disenchanted external nature, the evolution of Western thought has been based on the repression of the feminine, on the repression of undifferentiated unitary consciousness, of mystical participation with nature: a progressive denial of the anima mundi, of the community of being, of the all-pervading, of mystery and ambiguity, of imagination, emotion, instinct, body, nature, woman, of everything in which the masculine has projected itself by identifying it as 'other'.\"",
